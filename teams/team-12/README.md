# 👑 Multi-Agent Event Planning Orchestrator

A complete, production-ready cooperative multi-agent application developed for a 12-hour hackathon submission. The system leverages autonomous, domain-specialized agents acting in parallel to plan large academic or corporate events, synthesized by a central coordinator agent into a unified, styled master timeline, vendor brief, and communications pack.

## 📦 Dataset Sourcing & Grounding

To provide highly realistic, data-backed planning recommendations, the orchestrator integrates two primary datasets:
1. **Kaggle Tech Meetup Dataset (`data/meetup_events.csv`)**: Contains over 150 realistic meetup records in 10 global cities. The Venue Agent queries this CSV to compute historical average attendance sizes and pricing ranges, ensuring recommended venue capacities strictly accommodate expected guest counts.
2. **Asana Event Template (`templates/event_checklist.json`)**: Pre-populates five phase milestones (Initiation, Sourcing, Logistics, Comms, Execution) inside the Coordinator Synthesis engine.
3. **AgentBench Benchmark Schemas**: Guides task coordinate quality, latency tracking, and budget safety constraints.

## 🖥️ Streamlit Interactive UI Pages

* **Page 1 — Event Input Form**:
  * Event Name, Type (Academic / Corporate / Cultural), expected guest counts, city location, date, theme domain, budget tiers, and dietary requirements.
* **Page 2 — Agent Dashboard**:
  * Shows each agent's name, active running status, dynamic progress loading bar, and individual Markdown log cards updating in real-time.
* **Page 3 — Final Event Plan**:
  * Unified Strategy metrics cards, master timelines table, vendor service briefs (venue, catering, AV), speaker lists, email copy tab panels (Attendee, Speaker, Reminders, Thank You), and a download button to export the finished MS Word strategy.

5. **Speaker Profiles**: Detailed bio summaries, abstracts, and estimated honorarium costs.
6. **Logistics Checklist**: Operational bullet points for technical AV setup and transportation rules.
7. **Communication Pack**: Copy-paste ready drafts for all 4 emails formatted inside highlighted console containers.
