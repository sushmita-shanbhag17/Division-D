# 📚 Multilingual STEM Explainer

## Problem Statement

Many students, especially from rural and regional language backgrounds, struggle to understand STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts because educational content is often available only in English.

This language barrier reduces comprehension, engagement, and interest in STEM subjects.

The goal of this project is to make STEM education more accessible by providing multilingual explanations, localized examples, and audio support.

---

## Project Overview

Multilingual STEM Explainer is an AI-powered educational platform that generates STEM concept explanations in multiple languages and difficulty levels.

The application uses Google's Gemini API to generate concept explanations and provides audio narration for improved accessibility.

The platform currently supports:

* English
* Kannada
* Hindi

along with localized Karnataka village analogies to improve concept understanding.
