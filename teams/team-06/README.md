# Smart Podcast Generation from Academic Research Papers

## Overview

Smart Podcast Generation from Academic Research Papers is a Generative AI-powered system that transforms research papers into podcast-style content. The system analyzes research papers, identifies research gaps, generates conversational podcast scripts, and produces supporting content such as show notes, key terms, and timestamps.

The objective is to improve research accessibility and science communication by enabling users to consume research papers in an engaging and easy-to-understand format.

## Problem Statement

The growing volume of research publications makes it challenging to communicate scientific findings effectively. Research papers are often lengthy, highly technical, and difficult for non-specialists to understand.

This project addresses the problem by automatically converting research papers into podcast-style content, making scientific knowledge more accessible and easier to consume.

## Dataset Used

### Scientific Lay Summarisation Dataset

Source:

https://huggingface.co/datasets/pszemraj/scientific_lay_summarisation-plos-norm

Dataset Characteristics:

* 24,000+ Scientific Articles
* Human-Written Layman Summaries
* Designed for scientific content simplification

Purpose:

The dataset is used to provide examples of how complex scientific content can be transformed into simpler and more understandable explanations. These examples guide podcast generation and improve content accessibility.
